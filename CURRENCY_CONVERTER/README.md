---------------------
---------------------

Description:
-----
Converts a certain amount money inputted from one currency to another.<br>

SIDE NOTE:<BR>
---------- 
-->DUE TO THE API AND URL'S AVAIBLE ONLINE I COULD NOT FIND ONE THAT OFFERS ANY OPTIONS TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE THE BASE CURRENCY WITHIN THE AVAILABLE FREE PREMUIMS AND I CANNOT AFFORD THE PAID PREMIUMS.AS A RESULT,I USED OPENEXCHANGE'S API AND URL WHICH USES ONLY USD AS THE BASE CURRENCY BUT CAN GET EXCHANGE RATES OF ANY TARGET CURRENCY.


CODE EXECUTION:
---------------
For the code to execute run the following in the terminal (after cloning the CODSOFT repository):<br>
*java Converter*
